An Overview of the Whole Dashboard: This TripAdvisor Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of hotel data, offering insights into hotel ratings, user demographics, travel preferences, and available amenities. I designed this dashboard in Tableau, starting with a bar chart displaying the distribution of hotels by star rating, revealing that most hotels have a 5-star rating. A Venn diagram visualizes user stays by period, indicating peak periods for hotel bookings. The bar chart categorizes users by continent, showing that North America has the highest number of users. The treemap classifies traveler types, with couples being the largest group, followed by families and business travelers. The top 10 hotels by total rooms are listed, with The Venetian Las Vegas Hotel leading. I also created a matrix highlighting hotel services such as free Wi-Fi, exercise rooms, clubs, and basketball courts, making it easy to compare amenities. This dashboard offers a clear and interactive view of hotel performance, user preferences, and available facilities.
The main insight from this TripAdvisor Dashboard is that North American users dominate hotel bookings, and most hotels have a 5-star rating, indicating a preference for luxury stays.
